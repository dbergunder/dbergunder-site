> It's not that I have poor grammer, it's that my keyboard is insubordinate.

As my first foray into any kind of public technical writing, I decided I would start off by explaining _why I am writing_.  With so many paths for jumping into the web development community - either via contributing to open source, writing articles and tutorials, or presenting at technical conferences; this seemed like the best start for me.  It shouldn't be unheard of for a more senior developer to role up their sleeves and write some documentation about company development practices, policies, or to explain how an api works. I feel like blogging is a natural extension of that.  I am also pulling a lot of inspiration from other developers who've done the same, and my goals are as follows:

* at least an article per month
* topics relevant to me, but may be useful for everyone
* accept criticism (but tred lightly on the internet)

## whoami <small>no seriously who is this guy?</small>
I am a Web Application Developer currently working as the Lead Web Developer for the International Code Council.  We build some pretty robust applications, mostly in the Symfony framework.  I have been in the tech industry for well over 10 years, but have a mixed bag of experiences.  I am humbled by the enormity and evolution of the web, the spring of languages and frameworks, and the community that drives it's innovation.  I think I can confidently say that I have been baptised in many hard learned lessons in development.

## self improvement <small>starve the ego, feed the soul</small>
Blogging is going to give me a way to diversify.  I _love_ programming.  I thoroughly enjoy web development and all the unique challenges I solve, but I struggled figuring out how else I can grow as a web developer.  _The more you know, the more you realise you don't really know anything, and if you focus on one thing too much you tend to fall behind._  I am at a point where I want to transision my career to take on broader scopes of strategy and planning; architecting systems and technology solutions.  So I really need to start focusing on how well I can communicate technical concepts.

## career growth <small>gotta have something to aim for</small>
Lets be honest here, career planning in web development is _kind of a shit show_.  Titles are meaningless.  Long stints at companies are rare.  This industry demands you prove you know what you're doing.  My metric right now will be putting words out there and contributing what I know, and hopefully helping out other developers and learning something new myself.

## not an island <small>not a taco either</small>
If you're interested in writing, go for it!  it was pretty easy to setup a static site in [Hugo](https://gohugo.io) (free!) and host on [github pages](https://pages.github.com/) (also free!).  You'll need to know markdown and how to get aroud the command line, but the experience can be pretty rewarding.
